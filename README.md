# YouTube-Downloader
A HTML script where you can download YouTube videos in any format from MP3 and MP4 in a variety of different resolutions.

## Disclaimer

Downloading videos from YouTube is against the YouTube Policy. The only videos that your allowed to download is your own which you can already do using YouTube Studio.

## Note
Ignore the redirects it is not part of the code I wrote but is sadly part of an open source api which allows you to convert and download the file which I used.
